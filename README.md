jade, compass, coffeescript, and AngularJS to orchestrate the whole
thing nicely

TODO

- Grunt tasks
    - create Gruntfile according to directory structure
    - packaging and minification scripts
    - template optimization on packaging for angularjs

- make the generator work just from coffee (no js files)
- use sintactic versionning
- publish it on NPM repository
- auto livereload injection on development
- support for requirejs
- subcommands to:
    - generate modules
    - generate controllers on modules
    - generate services
    - add dependencies (inject both in bower and on require config)
